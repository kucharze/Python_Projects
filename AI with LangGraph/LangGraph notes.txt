Elements

State
- A Shared data tructure that holds the current info or context of app
- The application's memory

Node
- Individual functions and operations that perform specfic tasks within the graph
- Each node recieves input, processes it, and produces an output or updated state

Graph
- The overarching structure
- Maps out how different tasks(nodes) are connected and executed
- Visualy represents the workflow
- Think of as a road map that determines what routes you can take

Edges
- The connections between nodes
- Determines the flow of execution
- Tell us which node should be executed next after the current one
-- Conditional Edges
--- Specialized connections that decide the next node the execute based on specfic conditions or logic applied to the current state
--- Think of like a traffic light

Start node
- A virtual entry pointn in LangGraph, marking here the workflow begins
- Doesn't perform any operations itself
- Serves as the designated starting position for the graph's execution

End node
- Signifies the conclusion of workflow in LangGraph
- Upn reaching this node, execution stops, indicating that all intended processes have been compleated.


Tools
- Specialized functions or utilities that nodes can utilize to perform specfic tasks such as fetching data from an API
- Enhance the capabilites of nodes by providing addtional fnctionalites
- Nodes are part of graph structure, while tools are functionalities used with nodes
